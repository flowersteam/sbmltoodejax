# Welcome to SBMLtoODEjax!

SBMLtoODEjax is a lightweight library that allows to automatically parse and convert SBML models into python models written end-to-end in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), 
a high-performance numerical computing library with automatic differentiation capabilities. 
SBMLtoODEjax is targeted at researchers that aim to incorporate SBML-specified ordinary differential equation (ODE) models into their python projects and machine learning pipelines, 
in order to perform efficient numerical simulation and optimization with only a few lines of code (by taking advantage of JAX‚Äôs core transformation features). 
For an overview of SBMLtoODEjax‚Äôs advantages and limitations, please check the [üëÄ Why use SBMLtoODEjax?](./design_principles.md) section.

SBMLtoODEjax extends [SBMLtoODEpy](https://github.com/AnabelSMRuggiero/sbmltoodepy), a python library developed in 2019
for converting SBML files into python files written in Numpy/Scipy. 
The chosen conventions for the generated variables and modules are slightly different from the standard SBML conventions (used in the SBMLtoODEpy library) 
with the aim here to accommodate for more flexible manipulations while preserving JAX-like functional programming style. 
For more details on the structure/conventions of the generated files, please check the [üé® Design Principles](./design_principles.md) section.

## Quick start

:::{admonition} Install
:class: note
SBMLtoODEjax can be installed via pip. See our [Installation](./installation.md) guide for further details.
```bash
pip install sbmltoodejax
```
